\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'a0Dear Editor in chief,\
I'm sure you must of heard of the game Monopoly, but have you wondered what it means?\
A monopoly is defined as a market structure in which only one firm or a group of firms acting together is catering to the market. A monopoly has 100% of the market share. The market share is the value a company's sales against the value of the entire market's sales and as the company is the only company in the market, it has a market share of a hundred percent. The company can set the price of its product to whatever it wishes; it is a price maker. If the market for the product is inelastic, the monopoly can increase its prices to earn a profit. However, this can be bad for the consumer; the consumer has no choice and can only buy at the price set by the monopoly. There are also many barriers to entry(which could be the reason the monopoly is the only company in the market). There are two types of barriers, natural barriers and artificial barriers. An example of a natural barrier is a legal barrier. Perhaps patents and copyrights are stopping new companies from entering the market. Another natural barrier is economies of scale(which are the benefits of production at a large sale such as buying in bulk, etc.). However there are also artificial barriers imposed by the monopoly to purposely destroy competition. An example of this is predatory pricing; when a new firm sets up shop in the market, the monopoly reduces prices to undercut those of the new firm, this causes the new firm to go out of business as its prices are higher than the monopoly's. After the firm has gone out of business, the monopoly increases the price again. The monopoly would make a loss in that brief time yet because of the size of the monopoly, it is not affected. Consumers are negatively affected because of the lack of power to influence price.\'a0Monopolies are generally looked down upon. This is because many monopolies are exploitative and behave oppurtunistically.\
\
This is why governments try to control monopolies. They earn abnormal profits, can be inefficient due to the lack of competition, lack innovation and could even reduce product quality to save on production costs. Competition on the other hand is more beneficial. The forces of competition incentivise innovation and efficiency. How? The goal of the firm is to earn as much profit as possible. The company could do so in two ways. The first method is that firms try to lower their prices so that they attract demand. The second method is by reducing the costs of production. Yet, product quality will be conserved as other companies make higher quality products and compete on non price factors to attract demand.\'a0Governments can control monopolies by setting up fines for abuse of market power, by breaking up monopolies into smaller firms, or by regulating the prices of the product sold by the monopoly\'a0(Moynihan and Titley).\'a0\
\
Tech giants like Apple, Facebook and Google are often criticised for their monopoly-like behaviour. A member of the US Government has even said that they are guilty of "bulldozing competition" which is predatory pricing(Ho, Vivian). As this could mean that consumers are exploited, the US Congress is looking into whether they are guilty of anti competitive behaviour(behaviour that prevents competition from entering the market) and if they are guilty of collusion where the firms act together to form a monopoly of firms. These tech giants could be controlling important online activities like commerce, content and communications(Vivian, Ho).\'a0\
\
Not all monopolies are bad. Some monopolies are beneficial. They conduct research into innovative new ideas like the jumbo jet or the photocopier. These innovative products would not have been possible without the abnormal profits generated through a monopoly They are in turn rewarded with these profits for their innovative work. Some competition could be wasteful as they spend on advertising and marketing. Monopolies are free and do not have to worry about competition. Competition could have pulled away monopolies from chasing dreams and instead made them worry about their efficiency and marketing strategies and we would not see such world changing products as the jumbo jet.\
