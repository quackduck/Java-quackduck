All the Java I have ever written.


I'm still learning Java.
Small projects are in the [Small-Projects](./Small-Projects) directory. All the others are in the root dir. You are free to do whatever you want with this code. It's pretty basic code anyways, so I have no idea why you would even copy stuff from here(Maybe if you were a beginner I guess. I'm one too!). Have a great day!
